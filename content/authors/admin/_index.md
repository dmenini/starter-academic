Hi! I have recently acquired a M.Sc in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at ETH Zürich, where I focused on Hardware Design, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. While completing this program, I spent 4 months as a Teaching Assistant for Prof. Luca Benini to supervise students with FPGA programming. Prior to starting my Master at ETH Zurich, I graduated from the Electronics Engineering Bachelor program at Politecnico di Milano. 

Currently, my research interests are real-time 3D Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
